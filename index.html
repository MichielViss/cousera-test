    <div class="fuckingloser">
      <p>Wank stain actually managed to get something correct it only took him like 25 years to get it running</p>
      <p>I think this might actually be working. The only thing that is left to do is the actual creation of the site itself I think this is going to be my webpage that actually I am going to host and then I will post my gamedev stuff on here.</p>
      <p>Perhaps this actually might become place where i store all my stuff that i am learning along the way</p>
      <div class="body">
        <p>All the Zenva stuff and Udemy stuff and even the SAP knowledge that i have picked up along the way. I really want to get into the development role within SAP i need to check out what SAP and Python libraries are available and see what i can do with that because maybe I can create like a data science offering for the warehousing component of SAP</p>
